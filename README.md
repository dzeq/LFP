Looking For Pokemon is an API which provide you a way to CRUD a Pokemon list.

It tooks me some hours to do this REST API. Some more hours could be spend to enhance it.

Dependencies have been used to make the work faster.

CRUD Methods are implemented. You can find the interactive documentation here :

# Teck Stack
Symfony5.2 - Php7.4 - MariaDB10.4

Tested with phpunit, they run in CI with Circle-CI.

I used api-platform to make the CRUD implementation faster.

I used swagger(open-api) to provide an interactive documentation based on Entities.

Application is deployed with Scalingo.
